# Week 4 Functions

Charged with simulating Burger's Equation, we began with code from Manuel Ramsaier. He [explains](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE4jpqcRJiBpODH_ksfgJmKsSc9-CN3_A) how he produced [the code](https://goo.gl/o4sHVL) necessary to visualizing Navier-Stokes equations. We adapted this base code to apply to our initial conditions as well as more general functions.

This week was largely exploratory to conceptualize the differential systems which we will be encountering as well as the coding systems avaialable to assist us in visualizing them.

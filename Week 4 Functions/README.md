# Week 4 Functions

Charged with simulating Burger's Equation, we began with code from Manuel Ramsaier. He [explains](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE4jpqcRJiBpODH_ksfgJmKsSc9-CN3_A) how he produced [the code](https://goo.gl/o4sHVL) necessary to visualizing Navier-Stokes equations. We adapted this base code to apply to our initial conditions as well as more general functions.
